This repository is a sandbox for personal feather huzzah projects.

## Building
Tested in WSL Ubuntu 20.04 LTS. The vendor submodule depends on Python2 and python2-pip, which
aren't available in the default Ubuntu 20.04 repository.  Instead, follow the steps
[here](https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-pip-on-ubuntu-18.04)

## Flashing
Use `flash.sh` to flash the device. Flashing from WSL does not work.
